# My Journey
At the end of 2021, I began my journey with HTML and CSS, expanding into Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL. I freelanced with these skills until June 2023. During the freelance period, I have worked with raw HTML and CSS. Then I started learning JavaScript-based front-end and basic back-end development in July 2023.

Afterward, I collaborated on some contractual projects. In particular, I got an opportunity to develop a ‘data collection system’ for around 200 primary schools that won first place in a divisional competition of the primary education department. That significantly enhanced my skills. These projects were a blessing for me. I have learned such knowledge that I couldn’t learn without working on a real-world project.

Currently, I am learning new technologies to become a proficient MERN stack developer.

### 💪Key strengths:

➡️ **Vanilla CSS**: Experienced with vanilla HTML and CSS

➡️ **Strong design sense**: As a front-end developer, I have a strong design sense

➡️ **Team Player**: I can work seamlessly with designers & back-end devs

➡️ **Clean coder**: My code is efficient, readable, and accessible

➡️ **Curious Learner**: I'm eager to explore new technologies and stay ahead of the curve


🤝 Collaborative by nature, I bring a thoughtful and communicative approach to team projects. Aiming to contribute to innovative projects at a company making waves.
